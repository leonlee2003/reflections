How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

In order to use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files, you
would use the command line interface to navigate to the directory containing the 
repository. You would then use the command git log to view the history of the files. 
Once you do this you can choose the ids of the commits you would like to compare (hopefully)
consecutive commits. This would show you the changes made between the two consecutive 
commits. I think that this process is as intuitive as it could possibly be, but it is going 
to take a little practice to get used to.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
that could break something?

Making changes without any form of version control can be a bit nerve racking
because there is always the possibility that you may not be able to undo 
any mistakes that you make. But, with version control, it's easy to figure out
where bugs were introduced (ie which version), the git diff command makes it
easy to figure out which line caused the bug.
